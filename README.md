This program asks the user to enter 10 integers between 1 to 100 and it will tell the user largest number, smallest number, and the average from the 10 entered integer by the user. If the user enters a negative number or number that is greater than 100 it will output an appropriate message and it will ask the user to try again. 
The program starts with a welcome message. After that, the program asks the user to enter 10 integers between 1 to 100. There is a while loop created to check if the user has input integer between 1 to 100 if not it will out a message to user to try again with integer between 1 to 100. To find the average of the integer that the user has entered. Input the average formula average=(float)add all the integers that user entered divide by total number of integers enter. After that, to find the smallest integer from the user input value. Input the smallest value formula I=0; I<total number of value input by user; I++. To find the largest integer from the user input value. Input largest value formula I=0; I< total number of value input by user; I++. Output the result of Average, Smallest value, and largest value from the user input value.
